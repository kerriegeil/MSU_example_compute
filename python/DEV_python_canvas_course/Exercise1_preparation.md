## Exercise 1 - computer set up and data preparation

Descriptions: This course covers how to do everything in the DEV_python course 
using only free open source python in jupyter notebooks, i.e. without using GIS
or arcpy. This exercise covers installation of the free open source tools as 
well as the preparation of data needed to complete the course excercises.


Outline<br>
- Explanation of the different tools vs what is used in DEV_python
- Software Installation<br>
- Python/Jupyter IDE<br>
- Python<br>
- Conda?
- Intro to Jupyter notebooks

Data Preparation:<br>
- Explanation of why data prep is needed (this is aimed at folks who have their
data stored in ESRI formats like gdb. This format is proprietary to ESRI, so we
need to export to a format that is friendlier for open source free tools)
- Export gdb feature layers to individual shapefiles 
- Discussion of other data formats that are easily loaded using python
