This directory contains examples of how to submit compute jobs in different
languages to the SLURM job scheduler on HPC Orion. Description of contents is
below. Note, in order for any example to run properly you need to enter your 
fund account number in the slurm batch script.

slurm_scripts/slurm_example1.sh 
run fortran hello world a single time, no parallelization

Inputs: fortran_programs/hw77, fortran_programs/hw90
Outputs: slurm_scripts/outputs/example1.out, slurm_scripts/errors/example1.err

Description: This example is equivalent to running the fortran program once on a 
normal, non-hpc computer. The SLURM batch script names the compute job "example1",
tells the SLURM job scheduler to use 1 node to run the compiled fortran program 
hw77 (helloworld.f) one time on a single processing core (CPU), then run the 
compiled fortran program hw90 (helloworld.f90) one time on a single processing 
core. SLURM outputs all echo statements in the batch script as well as any print 
statements in the fortran program to the file example1.out. If any errors were 
encountered, SLURM writes them to the file example1.err, otherwise this file will 
be empty.

slurm_scripts/slurm_example2.sh
run a fortran program with different inputs many times simultaneously (embarassingly parallel)

Inputs: fortran_programs/rw90, inputs/dummy_data.txt, inputs/dummy_scalefactors.txt
Outputs: results/variable1_#.txt, slurm_scripts/outputs/example2_#.out, slurm_scripts/errors/example2_#.err

Description: This is an example of embarassingly parallel computation. We run 1 
script 100 times simultaneously. Different inputs are sent to each execution, but
each execution is independent of every other execution (no run requires data from
the completion of any other run). The SLURM batch script names the compute job
"example2" and tells the SLURM job scheduler to execute all statements in the batch
script 100 times simultaneously, each time on a single processing core/CPU. The
batch script says to include the SLURM array task id in the name of each .out and
.err file. This task id is also used to pass a different input to the fortran 
program, which will then write a different data output file with the task id 
included in the file name each time the program executes.
